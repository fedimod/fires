Add human-friendly "slugs" to Labels

This changeset provides prettier URLs for human visitors, whilst still using the unchanging UUID identifier for use in datasets and machine-readable contexts. Additionally, it adds interlinking between the admin panel and the logged out homepage, and introduces copyable input boxes for the URL/IRIs of labels.
