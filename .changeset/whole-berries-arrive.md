Add localisation of Labels

This adds the ability to translate labels into different languages. The localization is supported both in the JSON-LD responses, and in the administration panel which allows you to view a label in different languages, if it has been localized. The admin panel also supports adding and removing label localizations (though this does require javascript), and the API also supports working with localization of labels (though this is untested).
