# Conformance Tests

> [!CAUTION]
> This section of the documentation is still being written

As FIRES is both a [protocol](../protocol/index.md) and [reference server implementation](../../manuals/reference-server/index.md), we're working on a comprehensive suite of conformance tests, such that anyone wishing to implement the FIRES protocol can assert that they are implementing it correctly.
