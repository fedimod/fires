Implemented Labels API

This provides a new set of APIs to the FIRES reference server, as well as documenting the API of the Labels endpoint(s) in the FIRES protocol.

The FIRES protocol covers reading the collection of all labels and retrieving an individual label as both `text/html` and `application/json` or `application/ld+json`.

The non-standard API for managing labels covers creating, updated, deprecating and deleting labels from the FIRES reference server.
